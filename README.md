# Brian Games

## The program offers to user one of five math command line console games and processes his answers.
## The main task was to set up the environment, install applications through the package manager, 
## connect additional libraries, create a git repository, work with the terminal and set up a linter.

Main goals:
* Setting up the project environment (npm, babel, eslint, node.js)
* Code analysis / Eslint
* Checking code with CodeClimate
* Continuous Integration / CI (Github Actions, Travis)
* Working with the command line


## Game: "Is Even"

A random number is shown. You need to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd!

Start:

```
   $   brain-even                                                           
```

## Game: "Calculator"

A random mathematical expression is shown, for example "35 + 16", which you need to calculate and write down the correct answer.

Start

```
   $   brain-calc                                                          
```

## Game: "Nod"

Two random numbers are shown, for example "25" and "50". You need to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

Start:

```
   $   brain-gcd                                                           
```

## Game: "Arithmetic progression"

A series of numbers is shown, forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. It is necessary to determine this number.

Start:

```
   $   brain-progression                                                      
```

## Game: "Is it a prime number?"

A random number is shown. You need to answer "yes" if the number is prime, or "no" if not!

Start:

```
    $    brain-prime                                                      
```

Install: 

```
    $   npm install -g yura-first-frontend-project                   
```
